### What is Aftendo?

Aftendo is a group of people who are reviving some apps on the Nintendo 3DS platform, for free, and open source.

### Why do Aftendo exist?

Some 3DS apps still haven't been revived, like Nintendo Zone - that is, until we come. 

Our job: revive what is left to be revived. 

### Licence

Each repo has its own licence. To see what you can do with each of our projects, check that project's repo LICENCE file.
